ANSWER TO QUESTIONS ABOVE

Yes! Indeed I have learnt alot.



What new skills have you learned?


Well I learnt how use multiple elements in building a project. I learnt 
about MockUps and how to translate a design into a live website. Above all,
with the many projects i had to do, i am more confident of my ability
to use HTML.



What has been easy?


So far, the lesson has been easy. Well detailed that literally anyone
can understand it. So i will say, everything has been easy and well
explained.



What has been difficult?
  

Nothing has been difficult.



How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first 
project to overcome challenges so far?

As I said early, the first challenge I faced coming into this was myself.
Now, all those self doubt and fears are gone.
Now I know exactly how to structure each line of code and what
is expected of each syntax and code output.
